## Tracks and Analyzes Election Committee Contributions

## Purpose
Candidate Committees receive contributions from Indivisuals all year round. My project is aimed at ingesting raw datasets of the Indivisual contirbutions from the FEC website and processing this dataset to allow data analysts and data scientists to draw useful queries. The analysis I would like to see with this data is when and where (by zipcode, state) does the rate of existing contributors change vs rate of new contributors. If the contributions are coming from high income neighborhoods vs low income neighorhoods. This analysis and processed data can help election committees strategize locally and more effectively.
