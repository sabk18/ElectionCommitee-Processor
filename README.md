# ElectionCommittee-Processor

## Tracks and Analyzes Election Committee Contributions

## Problem Statement
Election Committees receive contributions all year round. There are four main sources of funding: Small Individual Contributors, Large Individual Contributors, Political Committees and Candidates own money. My project will help Campaign Marketing teams understand the distribution of these contributions with respect to location and time helping them launch more effecient fundraisers and marketing strategies.
